Creating electronic devices is another skill and hobby.
Similar to automating things with scripts, I like automating
processes in my house.

For example, I created a plant hydro-sensor that reports me if
a plant needs more or maybe even less water.

Additionally, I got some experience with 3D printing and
creating PCB's @home. Combined, it's a powerful skill not
everyone has!
