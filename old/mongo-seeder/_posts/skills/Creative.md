When planning, analyzing or designing a project, modelling
certain parts of the product can help a lot when trying to
understand the final product.

I prefer writing direct UML, but I am also familiar with UML
specific programs. In university we utilize VisualParadigm for
almost all design artifacts.

I love being creative. This includes drawing, modelling and
also making music!

I have some experience with applications like Krita,
PhotoShop, Blender, Maya 3D, Cinema 4D, FLStudio and LMNS.
Though being or liking creative things, doesn't mean I am
successful with it.

Speaking of coding: I rather solve tasks in a creative way,
then a old and maybe outdated way.
