Java application run in a virtual machine, but what about true
native application?
  
  
I started my native adventure with simple C applications, but
soon did more complex things with C++. I also started to look
more into byte/machine-code and assembly.
  
  
Recently, I started learning Rust. Rust introduces many
different and new concepts, while also prohibiting
anti-pattern. It also compiles to a native application but is
much more secure by design and sometimes even faster than C++
applications! I love it so far and am excited to look further
in it.
