# Interest: AI (Artificial-Intelligence) and ML (Machine-Learning)

I think of the entire AI & ML topic as 'reverse engineering' a (human) brain.
Which in itself sounds incredible already!  
But utilizing it for our own benefits?

I am also highly interested in the different technologies and theory behind AI & ML.
It seems to be so much different from 'traditional programming'.

Unfortunately, I haven't had any experience with AI nor ML yet.
I am currently unsure if my university will cover this topic, but nevertheless as soon as I find some free time I want to look into it.
