Ever tried developing without an IDE or at least a good
editor?

Using dedicated tools safes so much time. I utilize many
different IDEs, editors and tools. All for different languages
and sometimes even tasks.

My current main IDE is JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, coupled with
Visual Studio Code. IDEA mainly for Java and other JVM
languages like Kotlin, but sometimes also for Web-Development
and Rust. Visual Studio Code mainly for Web-Development, Rust
and Scripting, as well as, taking notes in e.g. Markdown.

Apart from that also other Jetbrains IDEs like CLion for C/C++
development or Visual Studio.
