Being able to hack a system and testing its security is
invaluable. Developers, who know how <em>bad</em> hackers try
to get into a system, can use that knowledge to protect and
precautionary secure the system.

I test my servers myself using penetration testing, spoofing
and some other techniques. Applications are developed with
security in mind. Everything important and vulnerable is
encrypted and securely stored. Passwords are secured,
encrypted and never the same, etc.
