# Skill: Java and similar languages

I started programming pretty young and Java was my first programming language!
At first, I had my struggles with Java and programming in general, but by now I am more than confident with Java.

## Similar languages & JVM

However, Java is an object-oriented programming language and many other languages are very close and similar to Java.
C# or C++ (see [Skill: Native](/blog/12)) are fantastic examples!

Additionally, some languages utilize Javas JVM.
Such a language would be Kotlin or Groovy.
Both languages look a little bit more like functional-languages but are still object-oriented.  
I've already worked with Kotlin and a little with Groovy in the past.

## University

In university, we also are mainly using Java for coding.
Almost all programming classes are exclusively in Java, except for those that teach another language like `Databases` does teach SQL or `Data Science with R` does teach us R.

Alongside the usual study classes, we **always** have a project running.
All projects are also using Java (so far).
