In university we learned the test-driven-development approach.
While test-driven might take a little bit more time, your end-result has less bugs, none to nearly none unused code, better code quality and and and ...

Initially we learned it only for Java, using JUnit and some helping frameworks like Mockito and RESTAssured.
Now, I also started to work test-driven with C/C++ (with gTest) and Rust.
