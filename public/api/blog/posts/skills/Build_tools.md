To have a project that everyone can work on, independent of
the operating system and IDEs or editors used, you need
build-tools. Also, if having a lot of external dependencies.

Build-Tools simply help optimizing productivity of projects!

I have worked with many different build-tools. Most of them
are only working for one language after all. For Java I prefer
Gradle, but in university we mainly work with Maven. For C/C++
I really enjoy CMake, but others like Make, QMake, etc. are
fine too. NodeJS and Rust[/Cargo] essentially come with their
own build-tools build in.
