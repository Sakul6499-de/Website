# Build tools & systems

Build tools & systems enable developers to work on the same project, while working with completely different systems, IDEs and editors.  
Being skilled and experienced in and with build tools & systems is an excellent skill for project managers, team leader and project masters.

To have a project that everyone can work on, independent of their favorite operating system or development environment, can be extremely valuable.
Everyone can work with their choice of system and tools without interrupting others.

Build tools usually also helps with handling a lot of dependencies.
Using e.g. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) or [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) make it as simple as adding the name and version of wanted dependency to a config and everything is ready!

Some more advanced build systems also integrate into IDEs and editors seamlessly.
For example, [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.com/) are excellent build tools, dependency managers and IDE-integrators, while being system and IDE/Editor independent.

Other tools, such as [CMake](https://cmake.org/), even go as far as generating whole projects for IDEs, editors and even other build systems (such as [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)).
