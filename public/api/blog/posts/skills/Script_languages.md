I love automating things!
  
I rather spend some time on a script, than repeating a task
over and over again. I am familiar with many script languages,
mainly (Ba|Z)SH though. Others include Batch/CMD, POSH
(PowerShell), Python and Ruby.
  
I am also currently experimenting with using a language like
Rust as a script language.
