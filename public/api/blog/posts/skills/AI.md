I think of the entire AI topic as 'reverse engineering' a
(human) brain. Which in itself sounds incredible already!
  
I also think the techniques used by AI and ML are something else
and completely different from 'traditional programming'.
Unfortunately, I haven't found a real use case yet to use and
experiment with AI on.
