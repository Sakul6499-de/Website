Virtualization can be pretty powerful.

With Docker, and similar software like Kubernetes and Vagrant, isolating an application and making it run almost universally has become incredibly easy.
Furthermore, making it easily scalable.

But other software like Hyper-V, VirtualBox and VMWare Player/Workstation, enable full-system virtualization.
Enabling users to develop and test their applications for and on other operating systems.
