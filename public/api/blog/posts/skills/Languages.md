# Skill: Languages I learned

## German

My mother language is german, I grew up in Germany and I speak German fluently.  
By definition, I am CEF C2-Level in german.

I can do everything from business-related german to casual conversations without much effort.

## English

I learned English in school as my second language.  
Admittedly, I had a rough start at first but later on, became fluent in English.
Before finishing my school education I also completed my LCCI CEF B1 business English certificate.

My everyday English should be somewhere around B2 to C1, though I also have no problem with writing, speaking or understanding business English.

## Spanish

In Germany, students are required to learn a third language during their secondary school education.
I chose Spanish.

I had much trouble with Spanish, though I'd like to say it was the constant teacher shift and cancelled lessons.

By now, I taught myself most of the basics.  
Although, I am by no means fluent nor secure in Spanish.

I may or may not be able to have a casual conversation or ask for help, but everything beyond that I doubt that I am capable of.  
I'd guess my Spanish at CEF A1, maybe A2 at most.

## Dutch

Before starting to study in the Netherlands I wanted to at least learn the basics of dutch.
So I applied for a dutch class at my university and completed it!
Dutch is very similar to german, thus I haven't had any problems with it.

The class aimed to be between CEF A2 and B1.  
I am capable of having casual conversations, asking for help and, depending on the topic, can even explain some topics to dutch students.

## Japanese

During primary school, I also started learning Japanese.  
I just loved and still love the culture, people and their language.

I taught myself most of the basics, before deciding to apply to a language school.  
Unfortunately, my primary school education was nearly over and with the switch to secondary education I had significantly less time.

By now I should be around CEF B1, though I got a bit rusty over the years.  
As soon as I find some free time (or more of it at least!), I wanna catch up with my lessons again.
