# Web-Development

Shortly after starting with Java, I started writing my own
little websites as side-projects.
Nothing special, but I got more and more into the whole Web-Stack and Web-Technologies.
This also primarily taught me how to design user-interfaces and front-ends.

Currently, I know a lot of Web-Technologies.
I started, of course, with HTML to structure websites and fill them with content.
Later I began to style my websites with CSS and finally looked into JavaScript to add Client-Side scripts.
At some point, purely static websites weren't enough anymore, so I looked into PHP.

By now, I replaced some of the 'traditional' languages with more modern ones.
Such as [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) instead of CSS and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) instead of JavaScript.  
I also prefer to build a Web-App with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), the backend server in [SpringIO](https://spring.io/) and overall avoid using [PHP](https://www.php.net/) for everything.

Building web-applications with many dependencies also became easier thanks to [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)!
For instance, this website is build using a lot of different dependencies (see [credits page](/credit)) and NodeJS makes it incredibly easy to manage, package and deploy.

While I don't dislike designing user-interfaces, front-ends and Websites, I prefer to use existing libraries, such as [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and modify them to my liking.Â´

## University

In university, we also learned how to build and design websites.

In one project we utilized HTML, CSS and PHP mainly.  
JavaScript was _forbidden_.

Another project required us to build a REST API.  
We used [SpringIO](https://spring.io/) therefore.
