Shortly after starting with Java, I started writing my own
little websites as side-projects. Nothing special, but I got
more and more into the whole 'WEB-Stack'.

Currently, I know a lot of web-technologies, such as: HTML,
CSS, JS and PHP. But I am also familiar with CSS-Preprocessors
like SASS, ES6 JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS and a lot more!

I also worked with frameworks like Bulma and Bootstrap in the
past. In fact, this website is build using Bulma!

---

This website is using ReactJS and Bulma mostly.

Both of course run with NodeJS!

I am still learning about more advanced ReactJS topics, but overall I am pretty confident with it already.

I also use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
Simply, because I like the type-safety more.

Although not in use here, I also worked with spring.io previously as a backend REST-Server in two university projects.
