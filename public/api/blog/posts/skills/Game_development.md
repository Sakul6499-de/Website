I enjoy playing games, though I prefer indie-games over e.g.
shooter.

But I also enjoy making games! Creating games is essentially
creating something new, that someone else might like. No
limits, pure creativity.

Unfortunately, making games is hard and takes a lot of time.
Which is why I never finished anything. Nevertheless, I have
experience with OpenGL and Vulkan, as well as many
game-engines and game-frameworks (like Rusts gfx-hal).
