Even before learning how to program applications I was pretty
confident with computers. This of course includes getting
around in the rather classic Office-Stack like Word, Excel and
PowerPoint.

With discovering linux I also needed a new alternative, so I
started looking into LibreOffice and OpenOffice.

By now, I am confident with almost all programs from these
Office-Stack, including designing documents.
