# Engineering a website + blog: Frontend

This post is about the **Frontend** of my website.
Since there will be many pages, I won't go over all.
But, the most important pages and maybe some interesting pages will be shown.

I should also mention that since this is a **new version** of my **existing** website / blog, I won't design that much.
I have some ideas about what should change and what should stay.
