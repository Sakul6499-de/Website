# Sakul6499.de [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/sakul6499.de/sakul6499.de/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/sakul6499.de/sakul6499.de/commits/master)

This repository holds the source code of my website.
My website is written with [React], [TypeScript] and [Bulma].
Additionally, I make use of [Simple-Icons] package for most of the icons I am using.

It is written in two parts:
The main/index page, which shows general information about myself and the blog, which will act more like a notepad for myself than an actual blog.
However, I figured that some of that may be useful for others, thus sharing!
It also gives me the possibility to reflect and share my opinion on certain things.

## Building

Building this project is as simple as calling `npm build` (or `yarn build`).
Additionally, `npm run` (or `yarn run`) should serve the build website locally and update on changes.

## Credits

This website is based on [Bulma] and the [Bulma-Start] project.  
The icons are mostly from [Simple-Icons], though all are modified and optimized by myself and some are freshly created!
